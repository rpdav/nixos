# List of imperative stuff done when setting up ad-hoc VM
May help to recreate it in a declarative way if I run VMs more often

## Initial VM startup
* Set up the VM through virt-manager (disk, RAM, etc)
* Mounted install disk
* Created default network when virt-manager asked
* Set bios to uefi mode
* started vm, set root pw, pulled ip from ip a

## Remote Install
Followed usual nixos-anywhere process
